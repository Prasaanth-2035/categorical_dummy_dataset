# üìåPassion Project: categorical_dummy_data

## ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer
This project aims to raise awareness about the significance of data validation and collection in data analysis. 

It emphasizes the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA), including statistical testing for categorical (qualitative) data using dummy datasets.

## **üéØObjective**
Analyze **categorical data** to uncover hidden patterns from **dummy data**. 

This process involves a step-by-step walkthrough of **data preprocessing**, including **data cleaning**, **exploratory techniques** such as **frequency analysis, cross-tabulation, statistical testing, data transformation**, and **visual exploration** to extract meaningful patterns.

## **üõ†Ô∏èRequirement**
This project was created in a **Microsoft Office Home and Student 2021** which made an Quick-analysis and queried dataset with **MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE 8.0.38.0** tools for data manipulation and 
retrieve data for further analysis.

# ‚úÖProject Motivation

## **‚èÆÔ∏èScenarios**
I developed Google Forms for college projects of my friends and reviewed the dataset with them, originally not planned for deeper study. 
Later, I chose to explore this qualitative (categorical) data through data mining. The work aimed to highlight the value of data collection and validation, while enhancing my grasp of categorical data and simple mapping methods.

I examined the data to reveal patterns and insights that could guide decisions based on evidence.

After completing this project, I was able to:
* Show why validating data matters before analysis by proving its impact on decision quality.
* Gather qualitative data via Google Forms, export it to Excel, and refine it by eliminating duplicates and NULL entries for cleaner analysis.
* Perform exploratory analysis, such as frequency counts, cross-tabulation, statistical tests, data adjustments, and visual reviews, to uncover useful findings.

## **üìÅKey Files**
I got an external dataset with help of my college friends, which connection to Marketing and sales ‚Äì a topic I am interested in. The dataset contains data on:

* Sales_Promotions,
* Promotions_Product_Type,
* Sales_Promotions_Frequency,
* Decision_Factor,
* Preferred_Promotions_Method,
* Sales_Promotions_Industry,
* Limited_Time_Purchase
* Promotional_Offers,
* Recommend_Promotion,
* Promotions_Hesitations,
* Sales_Promotions_Influence,
* Less_Appealing_Promotion,
* Product_TrialLikelihood,
* Sales_Promotions_Motivation,
* Product_Familiarity,
* Ad_Name,
* Ad_Motivation_Rating,
* Ad_Comparison_Rating,
* Degree_of_Descriptiveness,
* Time_Constraint,
* Ad_Recall,
* Ad_Concept,
* Advertising_Metric

### **üíºBrief Project Description**
__________________
I exported the responses from Google Forms into an Excel spreadsheet for further exploration and saved the file as [filename]. 

In Microsoft Excel, I quickly analyzed my project by accessing, cleaning, and splitting columns to properly structure the data. This dataset, which is entirely categorical (qualitative) in nature, was then mined for insights. 

Now, let‚Äôs dive into the details of my exploratory data analysis:

* **Frequency Analysis**: Calculated the occurrence of each category to reveal the data distribution.


* **Cross-Tabulation**: Generated contingency tables to examine the relationships between key variables.


* **Statistical Testing**: Applied chi-square tests to assess the significance of associations in the data.


* **Data Transformation**: Reshaped and normalized the dataset to enhance clarity and analytical accuracy.


* **Visual Transformation**: Created over ten visualizations to effectively highlight patterns and trends within the data.


## **üó£Ô∏èSummary of Patterning**
This project illustrates the critical importance of data validation and collection, uncovering insights that might otherwise lead to invalid conclusions. The process described here not only serves as a technical exploration but also tells a story of growth and discovery in handling categorical data.

* Explored cross-tabulation: Transformed Ad_Motivation_Rating (1-3 stars as low, 4 star as medium, 5 star as high).

* Identified the dataset as categorical, using qualitative descriptors over numerical values.

* Leveraged dummy data for frequency, cross-tab, statistical tests, transformation, and visualization.

* Delved into data mapping with advanced techniques like novel visualization, dimensionality reduction, and multidimensional scaling.

* Confirmed dataset invalidity, using it as a springboard for learning.

* Evolved from an initial invalid dataset to a robust framework for categorical data analysis.

* Demonstrated analytical patterns that underpin effective data validation and collection practices.
